Vivaldi was fond of saying that he could write concertos faster than his copyist could make the parts. Inspired by this, <i>Epoch Music</i> is a program that generates a multi-movement work which loosely follows the form of a Vivaldi concerto. The work can be for any sized ensemble, performing in any tonality, and, by utilizing constrained randomness, generates the fresh work for the ensemble. The score and sound sample provided below is an example output for a string orchestra. For a fresh score for your ensemble, <a href="#!/contact">contact</a> the composer.
