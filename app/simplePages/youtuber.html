A live youtube DJ improvisation with YouTuber, an online web tool designed for appropriating youtube playback as a time stretching video sampling utility.
This particular improvisation utilizes two recordings from <a href="http://sansduo.org" target="_blank">SANS; duo</a>,
both performing from a single score, provided below.
These recordings (as well as their reversals)
were then uploaded to youtube to be utilized in this mixing setup,
allowing for a single performer to manipulate and perform with the sounds of the collective ensemble.
