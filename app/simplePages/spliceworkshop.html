<h3>Workshop Description:</h3>
Brooklyn Motion Capture Dance Ensemble is dedicated to the art of sonification of movement. This workshop will be an exploration of our group's artistic practice, and will share best practices we've learned regarding collaborations among composers, choreographers, and creative coders. In our time together, we will discuss theoretical groundings, play with some AI-powered instruments, and perform a piece together as a group.

NOTE: To the extent that you are comfortable and able, this workshop will ask you to move with us. Comfortable clothing conducive to movement is encouraged but not required.
