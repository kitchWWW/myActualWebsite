<p>
Minimalism works to pare down the use of traditional musical features including harmony, melody, and rhythm. Through such reduction, the performer is more clearly exposed to the audience to showcase what in particular they bring to the piece of music. This principle is what I aim to put on display through the collection of works I presented on May 7th, 2018. Documentary video is available below.
