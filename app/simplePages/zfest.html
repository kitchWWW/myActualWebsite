I took part in the Sumer 2020 Z Festival, an online event formed to provide a new music festival experience for those whose summer plans had been reorganized to allow for social distancing in light of the global COVID-19 pandemic. I participated as a performer with Jane Kozhevnikova on her piece "The Crying Water", edited the video and audio for M Joseph Willette's piece "Spoken Words", and additionally composed and performed in a 48 hour marathon piece "Structured Music" with Cory Brodack!
