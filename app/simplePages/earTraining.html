Training one's ear to differentiate aural phenomena is a skill which many skilled musicians spend several years of their life developing. The increasing prevalence of audio data in the world, along with an increasing divide between the incumbent masters of this domain (musicians) and the challengers (programmers) has led to the need for recognition, reflection, and reconciliation. This musical album, training tool, and scientific dataset hopes to sit at a niche in providing space for all three.
