Drawing from Pauline Oliveros' practice of Deep Listening, and Alvin Lucier "I am sitting in a room", this installation invites mechanized listeners into the practice of intentional listening and sound art co-creation along with human listeners. In this installation, Humans, along with machines, are invited to:
<br>
<br><i>Listen for a sound
<br>Think about the sound
<br>Produce the sound from your thoughts of it
<br>Repeat </i>
<br>
<br>Humans and computers both follow these instructions, humans via their intuitive relationship to sound and language, and computers via an assortment of AI models. For the computers, sound from the space is recorded by a microphone, which is then described using an audio-to-text AI model (whisper derived). These textual descriptions are then fed to a text-to-audio AI model (AudioGen) which generates a sound file, which is then played back live in the room.
