2020 marked many firsts for many of us across the globe. A world-wide pandemic, protests for racial justice, and renewed vigor in the US national elections are just a few of the things that drove us to many new experiences. 2020 also marked a small personal first for me: It was the first time that I remembered in the month of November that I was going to be asked by my family to play Christmas music on December 24th. So I dutifully purchased a book of simple guitar music and got to work. And my goodness was it terrible. As was all the free sheet music I could find online! Thus, I resolved to sit down and arrange for myself something to solve a very specific problem: It doesn’t need to sound the absolute best, doesn’t need to be the most virtuosic, doesn’t need to have five billion songs, and doesn’t need to be the easiest to play: The aim of this collection is simply to be the easiest to <i>sightread</i>.

<b>Disclaimers:</b>
<br>
This collection is targeted at classical guitarists who can read notes on a staff, know chord shapes, and have reasonable technical proficiency. It is not a beginner’s book, there is no explanation of “pont.” or “dolce”, and there is no tablature. If that doesn’t scare you off, let’s get started!
