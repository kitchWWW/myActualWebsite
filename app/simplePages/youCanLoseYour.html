“You Can Lose Your Balance” is an evening-length audience-participatory interdisciplinary work for eight performers and three technical personnel. The work was produced by the Brooklyn Motion Capture Dance Ensemble, and was co-devised by myself and Erin Landers, our Movement Director, with extensive early development help from Joe Tennis. The work, which calls for four dancers, two dancing sopranos, two dancing instrumentalists, and a large suite of live electronics powered by capacitive touch sensors, examines questions of community, collective action, and interconnectedness.
