There is the old quote that goes “time slips through our fingers like grains of sand… the more you squeeze, the more sand trickles through your fingers” Music is not a tactile thing. As a time based medium, you and I can not hold on to the music that surrounds us any more than we can hold onto water in the ocean. However, with this piece, I try to give you special hands. Hands that can, for a moment, pause time and keep it there. Hands that can hold the music you hear closer to you.
