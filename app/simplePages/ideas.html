In 2019, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Apollo moon landing. In 2022, we will be mourning the 50th anniversary of the most recent of the moon landing. This piece expresses my personal hopes and desires for the newly invigorated space program, as well as a stark reminder of what dangers a concentrated effort would entail.

Space hardware and software is often a pragmatic mix of the old and proven with the experimental and bleeding edge. So too this work engages with these realities: a single delay is the only electronic manipulation of the basic looping audio file, but this is paired with modern hardware, and even more developmental web libraries.

The clip that makes up the core of this work is taken from President Reagan's speech regarding the Challenger disaster, commemorating Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe. He speaks of their bravery, of their knowledge of the risks, and most importantly what an incredible profession astronauts choose, something awe inspiring then, and still remains so today. Just as TV audiences in the mid 80s had grown used to the wonders of the space shuttle, so too I fear today's public will grow used to the sight of Space X landing reusable boosters and other former impossibilities. We must remain vigilant, remain reverent, and most importantly, remain inspired by the idea of space.
