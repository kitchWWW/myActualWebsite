<br>
A work in three movements that progress steadily away from traditional guitar technique. Includes an extensive percussive section, and the guitars used in performance take a beating! The work was premiered by Michael Blake (Guitar One) and Brian Ellis (Guitar Two) on Sunday May 10th, 2015 in Austin.
