<i>Playing Data</i> is a collection of algorithmically generated graphic scores, each filled with gestural line, figure, and shape. The scores individually are to be performed by any soloist or ensemble currently owning the NFT corresponding to the particular work. Each are meant to evoke chaos, absurdity, and the computerized (and yet often human) quest for understanding. All the images found in the graphic scores come from machine learning datasets, and thus are presented for the observer to attempt to find meaning within. The NFTs are currently hosted on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/graphic-score-series-1" target="_blank">OpenSea</a> and the price for each at time of minting is ~$15 USD. Student discounts are available, and in the event that Ethereum prices jump making the current listings exclusionary, I'll revisit the 0.005 ETH price point.
