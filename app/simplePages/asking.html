The installation consists of a snare drum affixed with a contact microphone and transducer, both powered through a laptop running Max/MSP. The participants activate the experience by hitting the drum, which then begins reacting to each hit. The audio for this video is representative of a single user interaction session.

Speech clips were obtained through interviews discussing the how the interviewee has responded in the past to unwanted sexual advances. They are people's reactions to getting hit on.
