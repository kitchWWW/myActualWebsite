Presented as part of the Good House Collective's Time Warp Concert, where old and new music is brought together and performed in the context of one another.

In this particular work, Philip Glass' String Quartet No. 3 - I is juxtaposed to two traditional fiddle tunes, The Clare Reel and The Green Gowned Lass. Songs and Interludes in Two and Three Parts is designed to fit in between these two pieces and highlight their similarities. The music is designed to be adaptable for a variety of instruments around a core of string quartet and guitar, the performing forces necessary for the two bookending works. The video below features Songs and Interludes in Two and Three Parts in its intended context.<br>

Songs and Interludes in Two and Three Parts begins at the six minute mark.
