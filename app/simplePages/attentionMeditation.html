This music, it doesn’t groove – 
<br>
It’s like cars driving past on the freeway.

These meditations aim to create soundscapes that draw attention to their various components, gradually emphasizing and minimizing different voices in the overall sonic mixture by modifying different sonic characteristics.  This creates a musical field that encourages the listener to engage with the multiplicity of sound, and all of the different ways performers can manifest sound into the world.
