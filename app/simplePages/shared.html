Our field of “New Music” is awfully abstract and gate-kept by a large number of compounding factors, including race, socio-economic status, and inequitable education. “Shared Music” aims to take one small step towards reducing those factors by extending an invitation to those trained not in music, but in dance. By expanding the community of performers whose actions we deem acceptable on the new music stage, we can work towards breaking down these barriers.
