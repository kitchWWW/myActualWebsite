<br>
Brian Ellis is a classical guitarist, composer, and new music advocate who is putting together a resource consisting of a collection of works for Classical Guitar and Live Electronics. The goal is to assemble a repertoire of pieces which may be performed back to back in a concert setting. Every work will be considered, and as many pieces as possible will be selected for the collection.
<br>
<br>
One piece per composer will receive a video of a score reading if the score is playable and presentable, and if the electronics do not present a financial burden.
<br>
<br>
Composers of pieces performed in concert will receive $200USD. ($100USD for miniatures)
<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b>
<ul>
<li>Works must be for solo Classical Guitarist (6 nylon strings, no right-hand pinky)</li>
<li>Guitar should be tuned in either standard eBGDAE or "drop d" eBGDAD</li>
<li>Works must include "live" electronics. Tape pieces are accepted for the collection, but will not be eligible for prize money.</li>
<li>Works may include extended technique, but must not require instrument protection (flamenco tapping, contact microphones, aggressive strikes, etc.)</li>
<li>Guitar preparations (adding paper clips, paper between the strings, etc.) must not take more than 30 seconds.</li>
<li>Electronics must be able to be run on a laptop with a basic audio interface, foot pedal, and one (or more) microphones. No external loopers, synths, etc. Basic midi keyboards with knobs, sliders, and buttons are acceptable. The idea is to be affordable and portable: If you have a specific question about electronics, please ask! Max/MSP, Ableton, Supercollider, etc. are all available.</li>
</ul>

<b>Guidelines:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Pieces of all skill levels are accepted! Beginner pieces also encouraged, and ideally it shouldn't take a PHD to read the piece at tempo.</li>
<li>Pieces of any length are encouraged, including miniatures (<1'30"), short and medium length pieces, "concert halves" (~30min), and "evening length" (45+) (If planning a concert half or evening length work, please reach out to chat about it!)</li>
<li>Other sounds for solo performer (theatrical performance aspects, found sound percussion, vocal components, body percussion, etc.) are also allowed and encouraged.</li>
<li>Scores do not need to consist of traditional notation, if not desired. (though this is certainly not discouraged)</li>
<li>Scores should be performanble by solo guitarist.</li>
</ul>
