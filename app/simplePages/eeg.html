Technology should enable all people, regardless of musical education, training, "talent" (parental income level) and other factors, to create interesting and engaging music. This piece is an improvisation performed on one such technological interface, a Muse EEG Headband. When powered through Max/MSP, the device allows the user to control pitch, volume, and timbre of an electronic instrument intuitively through their brain activity and small head movements.
