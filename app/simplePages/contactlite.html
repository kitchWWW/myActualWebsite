Program Note:
<br>
Contact Lite is a work about communication mediums, great distances, and navigating those challenges with the limited technology available to us. A work of sound collage and participatory actualization, this piece aims to encourage everyone to partake in exploring, creating, and communicating together. All of the audio samples you will hear were collected by members of the Third Coast Percussion team over the past year. Sound bytes they took while traveling, readings of text messages recorded while at home, and drones and other sounds recorded at the studio all find their way into the piece. These sounds coalesce to form a sonic tapestry of shared experience - one that we now share with you.

"Contact Lite" is an interactive multimedia work composed by Brian Ellis. The piece features four percussionists on one vibraphone. Players each wear conductive patches on their arms, and complete electronic circuits by physically touching one another and the instrument, actuating audio recordings of their own voices reading random excerpts from their email inbox. In live performance, the piece includes guided audience participation via a "cellphone orchestra," where the audience members are invited to play their cellphones as instruments by accessing a special website for the performance. In this studio version, the cellphone orchestra is realized virtually by the composer.
