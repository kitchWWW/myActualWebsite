SANS; duo is a new music duo seeking to expound upon the saxophone-guitar duet format. In their inaugural concert, they explore open form, improvisational, and performance art piece in tandem with traditionally notated and electronically augmented works. Jonathan Hostottle and Brian Ellis will be presenting music, sans baggage.
