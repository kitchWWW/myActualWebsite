Forged at the outset of the COVID-19 crisis, this piece for piano septet and optional voice aims to express a new aesthetic which makes collaboration more accessible and approachable for those new to making content for a distributed online format. It builds on the traditions of aleatoric music to create dense ever-evolving textures, delivered through a seven part cannon. The resulting rhythmic variations play off of the listener's expectations to find order in the chaos, allowing short snippets of saliency to emerge from the wash before fading back into the texture. In this way, the work also pulls heavily from the perceptual ideas of Steve Reich's drumming and other movements. Indeed the title takes after the naming convention of New York Counterpoint or Vermont Counterpoint as I believe we are here in a time demanding not localized music, but Nationwide Counterpoint.
