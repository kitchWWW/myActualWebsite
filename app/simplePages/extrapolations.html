"Extrapolations on a Vega Banjo" utilizes the Mozilla Hubs framework to present an installation & virtual sound walk focused on a giant tenor banjo. The work was built using Mozilla’s Spoke developer tool, and makes use of the standard deployment of Mozilla Hubs. The piece features a stylized model of an early 1900’s Vega banjo in an otherwise empty space at “sunset” where the participants can walk around to explore different areas - from standing on the head of the banjo, to walking down the neck, all the way up to the headstock. The banjo is adorned with recordings that were all sampled from the instrument and either time stretched or applied directly into the installation. The resulting mesh of sounds is harmonic, timberal, and expressly human as the piece explores the relationship among visiter/-performers, a musicians instrument, and the sonic experience one is able to create.
