The cyberworm is an augmented reality puppet designed and built for the show <i>How I Disappeared</i> lead by Tianding He. The puppet consists of a camera, laptop, and projector that takes the actor's movements and uses them to animate (in real time) the motions of an animation on the screen. In this way, Non Kuramoto (the puppeteer) can control the digital cyberworm via motion capture with their movements.
