zinetude is a 7 minute choose-your-own-adventure soundscape for you to create with your friends! 
<br><br>
Print out as many sheets from the PDF as you'll have performers (plus maybe a few extra) and then fold each sheet into a zine - instructions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keX3nBEcw2Y" target="_blank">here</a>. Each page is different, so feel free to use different books for each performance, or to swap books if rehearsing it multiple times.
