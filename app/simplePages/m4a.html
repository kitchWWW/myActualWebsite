Music for Audiences is a celebration of connection, shared experience, and communal co-creation. A four-part series curated by composer, computer coder, and multi-instrumentalist Brian Ellis, Music for Audience brings together musical creators from around the world to reimagine audience interaction in the 21st century. Through interactive livestreams, online installations, and a participatory zoom concert, we will spend our time together celebrating music and community â€” make no mistake, this is music for YOU.
