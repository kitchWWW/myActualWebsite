A web-based mixed reality installation produced in collaboration with the Playground Ensemble as part of their RemoteLab series that commissions musical and multimedia creative works designed specifically for the features and limitations of online conferencing platforms.

The work consists of a short prelude and thought centering exercise designed to introduce the user to the headspace of the work, and is followed by a ~8 minute performance that highlights improvisations recorded by members of the ensemble. The installation is mildly different for each participant, so the video provided above should be taken as a sample performance, not a definitive document.

Score for both the core installation as well as the prelude music that plays beforehand are available below:
