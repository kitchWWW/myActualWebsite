<i>Who Comes Home</i> is a six-movement musical collage focusing on the themes of home, integration, technology, and sense of belonging. Drawing on epic stories from literature, bluegrass, and cultural heritage, <i>Who Comes Home</i> frames historical stories within the context of a 21st century experience of abundance of information. By carefully orchestrating a found-sound sonic pallet, Brian works to create beautiful, evocative, and ultimately provoking dreamscapes, songs, and statements within this single musical work.

The piece is a guided improvisation, with electronics managed via a specialized Max/MSP Patch. With the exception of the interview heard in the fifth movement, the sounds and audio you experience during the course of the work are all produced live and captured, processed, and mixed in real time.

This video forms the documentation of a live performance event held on June 6th, 2019 and should not constitute a complete possibility space which the work inhabits, but instead simply one example of what the ideals, instructions, and impetus may produce.
