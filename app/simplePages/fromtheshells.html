Hi everyone :) I wanted to share this little sound bath / music video / loosely improvised performance with y'all. The piece is titled "From the shells you can't hear the ocean, but thats ok". This video really comes across best when viewed in a VR headset like Oculus Quest. I use the Youtube VR app, and that seems to work pretty well.
