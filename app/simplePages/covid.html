<br>
As an active composer alive in March 2020, this is my obligatory submission of an artistic work in a web-based format for distribution to express my personal declamation on the state of global and personal affairs in light of the current situation.
<br><br>
Notes on performance:
<ul>
	<li>Performer is tied to the guitar such that their slight movements cause larger-than-life (sonic) effects.</li>
	<li>Performer will be generally unable to move from the immediate area as they execute (dance) actions that are typically mundane.</li>
<li>The backdrop of the performance should be one over-saturated with a single (visual) theme.</li>
<li>Should the performer's bindings fall off of during the performance, the performer is to frantically put the twine bindings back on, as it is imperative for saving (musical) lives.</li>
<li>stay home</li>
</ul>

<br>
For solo performer, electric guitar, loose binding (twine), PJs, live electronics, and an empty apartment.
