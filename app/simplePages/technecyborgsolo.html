Techne Cyborg was a two night concert series and art gallery showing at pinkFROG cafe in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, showcasing musical and visual works that engage in human-computer interaction.
The first night's program was intense and thought provoking contemporary classical music, "The Cyborg Thinks". These are exerpts from my program performed that evening that I recorded afterwards.
