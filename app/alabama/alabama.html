The war on abortion that Alabama brought to the forefront of the national discourse in May 2019 was not only a war on human dignity, but continues to be a dangerous and misguided attempt to limit women's safety under the guise of protecting human life.
<br><br>
If we turn to the history books, we find an example of what may happen when a liberal society suddenly enacts a total ban on abortion, for in 1966, the leaders of Romania did exactly that. What became immediately apparent was that those seeking abortions were forced to turn to drastic measures, with disastrous consequences. While the Romanian law was intended to spur population growth, in practice it caused the maternal mortality rate to skyrocket.
<br><br>
This piece tracks the maternal mortality rate of women in Romania from 1950 to 2015, highlighting the ban on abortion from 1967 to 1989. The violin part is directly derived from this data: as the line rises, it reflects an increase in deaths, and as it falls, a return to civility. The electronics draw from several expressive sources, including interviews with people close to the subject as well as recordings of fetal heart beats, kitchen implements, and other electronically generated or manipulated sounds. It is my hope that this work is discomforting and unsettling, provides context and understanding, and will better allow us to divine the future of Alabama.
