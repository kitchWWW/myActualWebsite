The number of reported pregnancy-related deaths in the United States steadily increased from 7.2 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1987 to 16.9 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2016.
<br>...
<br>Each year in the United States, about 700 women die of pregnancy-related causes, and more than 50,000 have severe pregnancy complications.

<br>In 1966, the leader of Romania, Nicolae Ceausescu, outlawed access to abortion and contraception in a bid to boost the country’s population.
<br>...
<br>As a last resort, many Romanian women turned to home and back-alley abortions, and by 1989, an estimated 10,000 women had died as a result of unsafe procedures. 
<br>
<br>-- from Amy Mackinnon, staff writer at Foreign Policy
<br>
