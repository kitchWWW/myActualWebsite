<br>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<p>
Many piano sonatas of the nascent-classical period were based off simple patterns that provided a scaffolding allowing composers to easily produce both tuneful and structured works, with patters of how themes, transitions, and development sections fit together. These dominated in the early classical period as these patterns themselves were the new information for listeners to notice, a change from the highly developed and explored forms of the baroque.

<H2>In Simple Terms</H2>
<p>
Yo dawg, essentially this awesome prof gave us all huge lists of patterns and said "write a piano sonata", so I was all "this looks like something my computer can do better/faster than I can" and proceeded to spend about twenty times as much energy to write a program that can generate these sonatas, rather than write one out myself.

<H2>In Slightly More Informative Terms</H2>
<p>
As can be seen in the <a  target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kitchWWW/SonataGenerator"> source code</a>, the process of building a sonata is broken down in to several smaller simple steps. On the most basic level, these include:
<ol>
	<li>Choosing archetypes to use</li>
	<li>Developing the chosen archetypes</li>
	<li>Embellishment</li>
</ol>
</p>
<!-- <h3> 0. Getting the Archetypes in the first place</h3> -->
As I mentioned before, my incredible (late) professor <a target="_blank" href="https://music.utexas.edu/news/edward-pearsall-1954-2017"> Dr. Pearsall </a> provided us a list of examples to string together. These included two measure units like the opening option found below:

<br>
These could be paired together with closing options in Half Cadence or Perfect-Authentic varieies

<br>
These fragments can be strung together into four bar ideas (antecedents and consequents) which can intern be joined into eight-measure phrases. A couple of options for transitional structures connect the first theme to a second theme, another eight-measure phrase. Again, structures for development are provided (normally following a Circle of Fifths progression) that circle back around to a “standing on the dominant” passage which resolves back to the recapitulation. From here, it is simply a matter of ornamentation in the style of the genre, which again is done in one of a few simple pre-defined styles. From this point, the completely generated sonata is output to a <a target="_blank"href="http://www.lilypond.org">Lilypond</a> file and compiled for your viewing and listening pleasure!

Happy listening!
